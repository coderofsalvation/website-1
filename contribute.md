# What can I do for remoteStorage?

## I can code

### JavaScript

* Integrate RS in any of your apps. More apps means more users, means more
  developers, means more apps.
* Help out with the [reference
  client](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/). There are always
  [issues](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/issues) to work on
* Help with completing and improving the remoteStorage.js
  [documentation](./rs.js/docs/) (even if
  it's just questions or feedback). There is more detailed information about
  how to [contribute to the documentation](./rs.js/docs/contributing/docs).
* Contribute to any open-source remoteStorage app. Some of them are [listed
  here](/apps "Apps").
* Help improving and creating new remoteStorage.js [data
  modules](https://github.com/remotestorage/modules)
* Help improving [Armadietto](https://github.com/remotestorage/armadietto/), a
  maintained RS server based on node.js

### PHP

* Help out with [php-remote-storage](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/php-remote-storage), a remoteStorage server written in PHP

### Rust

* Contribute to [Mysteryshack](https://github.com/untitaker/mysteryshack), a light-weight, fast, self-contained RS server

### Ruby

* There is a maintained RS server implementation written in Ruby, consisting of an
  [accounts management app and UI](https://gitea.kosmos.org/kosmos/akkounts/)
  based on Rails, and a [RS HTTP API based on
  Sinatra](https://github.com/5apps/liquor-cabinet)
* There's an [integration test
  suite](https://github.com/remotestorage/api-test-suite) for testing local
  and/or live remoteStorage servers for API compliance, which is written in
  Ruby (minitest/spec).

### Java

* We'd like to create an Android sync adapter that synchronizes calendars and contacts. See [this thread](https://community.remotestorage.io/t/synchronization-with-carddav-caldav/307/4) if you would like to help.
* Create an Android app that integrates sharing, for e.g. URLs to the bookmarks category, or images to the shares module.

### C

* There's a [remoteStorage FUSE module](https://github.com/remotestorage/fuse)
  for mounting storages as filesystems, which needs upgrading to newer protocol
  versions and finishing in general.
* There's a [remoteStorage server](https://github.com/remotestorage/rs-serve)
  written in C (with a little node.js helper app), which needs upgrading and
  has some installation issues.

## I can design

* Improve the design of this website. The website repo is located at
  [https://github.com/remotestorage/website](https://github.com/remotestorage/website)
* Help improve the design of any RS-enabled open source (see e.g. [apps](/apps)). Or
  design a new one and find a developer to help you with implementing it.

## I can write

* Add and/or improve content of the RS website, or any other project-related
  content on the Web.
* Help us improve existing technical documentation. e.g. the [remoteStorage.js
  docs](./rs.js/docs/)
* Help improve documentation, description and marketing materials for
  RS-enabled open-source [apps](/apps) and [servers](/servers).
* Write about remoteStorage on your website, blog, social media, etc.. Explain
* the concept to users, developers, providers, and anyone else you think should
  know about remoteStorage's existence and how it works.
* Improve the language and clarity of the [protocol
  specification](https://github.com/remotestorage/spec)

## I can run servers

* Set up a [server](/servers) for yourself and maybe your family and
  friends!
* Become a commercial or non-profit storage provider. You can either implement
  your own or use [existing server](/servers) software as your basis.

## I can test things

* Use RS-enabled [apps](/apps) and/or [servers](/servers) and
  report issues and constructive feedback.
