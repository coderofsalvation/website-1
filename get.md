# Getting Started

Here's how to use an app that allows you to connect your own storage account.

## Step 1: **Get a remoteStorage account** ðŸ”‘

You might be used to signing up _with an app_, but here you sign up _with a storage provider_ so that you can use the same account with multiple apps.

- If a friend or administrator has set up an account for you, get the details from them.
- [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/beta) is a commercial remoteStorage provider that currently offers free storage accounts.
- A more extensive list of options can be found on the [Servers](/servers) page.

## Step 2: **Connect your storage** ðŸ”Œ

Once you create an account, return to the app to 'connect your storage', or explore some of the other [remoteStorage-compatible apps](/apps).
