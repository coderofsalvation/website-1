This page was moved from the old wiki and is in the process of being revised.

## History

The first draft of the remoteStorage protocol was originally developed by Michiel B. de Jong as part of the [Unhosted](https://unhosted.org) project in 2011 and has been published at a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/), which has since been deprecated. Since December 2012, the protocol specification drafts [are published as Internet Drafts at the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dejong-remotestorage/).

## Process

Every 6 months (max. 185 days) a new draft version is published, incorporating feedback and contributions from developers, providers and users. All discussion and spec development is done in open collaboration on [the public GitHub repository](https://github.com/remotestorage/spec). Everyone is invited to open new GitHub issues and/or pull requests with their questions, feedback, and changes.
